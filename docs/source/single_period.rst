Single Period MVA Optimization
==============================

A **single period optimization** is used in classic Harry Markowitz Mean-Variance Analysis (MVA) where a portfolio is always
rebalanced and has original weights.
In *okama* it's equivalent to monthly rebalanced portfolios as monthly historical data is used.

MVA Optimization is the most easy and fast way to draw an Efficient Frontier.
